This is the recipe for creating the pizza dough.

Step 1: Combine and mix lukewarm water, sugar, and yeast before letting sit for 5 minutes, or until the mixture
        becomes foamy and bubbly.

Step 2: Knead the dough until it becomes smooth rather than sticky. Extra flour may need to be added to reach desired
        consistency.

Step 3: Let the dough sit for 30 minutes, so that it may rise.

Step 4: Once dough is smooth and elastic, it is in the perfect form to roll into the desired shape.

(Optional) Step 5: Pre-bake in oven for no more than 5 minutes, until it looks set and a little bubbly. If it is brown
                at this point it has been pre-baked for too long.

(Optional) Step 6: If pockets of air formed while pre-baking, prick the pockets with a fork to allow the gas to escape.
