defect:

name:
    malformed dictionary

description:
    unrecognized key or missing key in dictionary, occurs when a key is referenced explicitly
    in the service layer or elsewhere.

severity:
    low - this is something that will likely not be reproducible by an end-user as the dictionaries will be
    automatically generated by the javascript.

priority:
    low - this should not affect the functionality overall but should be addressed to avoid
            man in the middle situations from halting execution

status:
    fixed - adjusted sanitize api and create reimbursement record methods to properly handle exception and
            convert the amount to a float.
