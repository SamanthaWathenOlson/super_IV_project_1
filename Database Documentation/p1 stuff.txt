added schema for p1 called project_one_sandbox should be prepended to all table names in sql queries

employees table: may be pre populated
	columns:
		employee_id(pk) username(varchar 36) password(varchar 36) first(varchar 20) last(varchar 20)
	

	actions:
		read to verify username and password

reimbursement_requests table:
	columns:
		reimbursment_request_id(pk) employee_id(foreign key points to employee_id employees) reason(int foreign key points to reason_id in reason) amount(dec 4, 2)
	other constraints:
		on delete cascade, check amount > 1 and amount < 1000

	actions:
		create, read, delete (cancel) a request should delete comments associated with reimbirsement_request_id in reimbursement_request_comments, 
			sum on amount by employee_id can be used for the total amount
	

	should include a response confirming the succesful creation of the request (shall include rr_id category amount and comment)
	should create entry in reimbursement_request_comments table (must give reason in comment section otherwise rollback creation and through error)
	columns should be normalized as all numeric entries thus use of seperate comments table

reasons table:
	columns:
		reason_id(pk) description(varchar 20)
	

	actions:
		read only

reimbursement_request_comments:
	columns:
		reimbursement_request_ccomment_id(pk) reimbursement_request_id(foreign key points to rr_id reimbursement_requests) comment(varchar 100)
	other constraints:
		on delete cascade


	actions:
		create, read, delete



create table project_one_sandbox.reimbursement_request_comments(
reimbursement_request_comment_id serial primary key,
rr_id  int,
reimbursement_request_comment varchar(100),
constraint rr_id_fk foreign key(rr_id) references project_one_sandbox.reimbursement_requests(rr_id) on delete cascade

);
